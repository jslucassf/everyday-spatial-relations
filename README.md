# everyday-spatial-relations

Used to describe the position of an object in relation to another, spatial relations play a crucial role in the proper understanding of spatial communication. The computation of these relations in the application level is important to locate objects in the space or even interpret a location description provided by a human.

This repository contains a set of algorithms implemented using the PGSQL language and the PostGIS extension. They derive polygons that match spatial relations used in daily communication, as proposed in a paper published in the paper ``Human Spatial Reasoning in Everyday Language: Inferring Regions that Describe Spatial Relations'', XXI Brazilian Symposium on Geoinformatics (GEOINFO).
